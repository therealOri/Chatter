# ChatterEye
Discord Chat logger. Log every message and attachment that gets sent on discord!
__ __

ChatterEye grabs chat messages & attachments from all servers your bot is in and from all of the channels it can see. You can also set it to only read from a server/guild of your choosing and a channel of your choosing in said guild. You can edit this in `config.toml`. Then it sends/Logs all chat messages into chat_logs.db, and saves attachments locally to '/attachments'.
The database is written in/for sqlite3, so you will need `DB Browser for SQLite` for viewing the databse.

# Notice
I am not responsible or liable on or off platform for the misuse or malicious purpose/applications of this code. Use at your own risk. If you get punished or banned, etc. for using this, that is ALL and FULLY on you. I made this code/project to be a proof of concept to show how easily you can log chat messages using discord bots/python code (pretty spooky right?). And I shall not be punished on discord or off of discord/platform for making this code or for the actions of others/those who do decide to use this code in any way for any reason.
