You can also set it to only read from a server/guild of your choosing and a channel of your choosing in said guild. You can edit this in `.env`. Then it sends/Logs all chat messages into chat_logs.db.
The database is written in/for sqlite3, so you will need `DB Browser for SQLite` for viewing the databse.

# Notice
I am not responsible or liable for the misuse or malicious purpose/applications of this code. Use at your own risk. If you get punished for using this, that is All and fully on you. I made this code to be a proof of concept to show how easily you log chat messages using discord bots/python code. And I shall not be punished on discord or off of discord for the actions of those who do decide to use this code.

**Selfbots are against TOS and can get the account being used as one banned/suspended. Please use at your own risk if you decide to use it for a selfbot.**
