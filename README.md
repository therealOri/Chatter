# ChatterEye
Discord Chat logger. Log every message that gets sent on discord!
__ __

ChatterEye grabs chat messages from all servers your bot is in and from all of the channels it can see. You can also set it to only read from a server/guild of your choosing and a channel of your choosing in said guild. You can edit this in `config.toml`. Then it sends/Logs all chat messages into chat_logs.db.
The database is written in/for sqlite3, so you will need `DB Browser for SQLite` for viewing the databse.
